# Machine Learning on Coursera
## Introduction
This repository contains all programming assignments of machine learning course taught by Andrew Ng.All the code base, data, screenshot, and images, are taken from, unless specified, [Machine Learning on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/)
## About the course
In this course, you will learn about the basics of  Machine Learning, understand how to build neural networks, and learn how to lead successful machine learning projects.The concepts are practised in MATLAB/OCTAVE.This is a 11 week Course and at the end of every week there will be a set of quizzes and Programming assignmemts(MATLAB/OCTAVE)
## OCTAVE
I have used OCTAVE-5.2.0_1-w64 version to implement programming assignments.You can download the same from [here](https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/octave/windows/octave-5.2.0_1-w64-installer.exe).Dont worry if you are a complete beginner to OCTAVE /MATLAB, a complete tutorial on OCTAVE is found in Course itself.

## Folders

#### Linear Regression
In this Programming Assignment (ex1) you will implement linear regression and get to see it work on data.


#### Logistic Regression
In this Programming Assignment, you will implement logistic regression and apply it to two diﬀerent datasets. 



#### Multi-class Classification and Neural Networks
In this Programming Assignment, you will implement one-vs-all logistic regression and neural networks to recognize hand-written digits.


#### Neural Network Learning
In this Programming Assignment, you will implement the backpropagation algorithm for neural networks and apply it to the task of hand-written digit recognition.



#### Regularized Linear Regression and Bias_Variance
In this Programming Assignment, you will implement regularized linear regression and use it to study models with diﬀerent bias-variance properties. 



#### Support Vector Machines
In this Programming Assignment, you will be using support vector machines (SVMs) to build a spam classiﬁer.


#### K-Means Clustering and PCA
In this Programming Assignment, you will implement the K-means clustering algorithm and apply it to compress an image.


#### Anomaly Detection and Recommender Systems

In this Programming Assignment, you will implement the anomaly detection algorithm and apply it to detect failing servers on a network.


#### Also Note!
> You can make use of the Discussion forums in the course so as to resolve any errors you face while doing assignments.
>You may also take help from the PDF files attached in each folder.
>After completing a part of the exercise, you can submit your solutions for grading by typing submit at the Octave/MATLAB command line. The submission script will prompt you for your login e-mail and submission token and ask you which ﬁles you want to submit. You can obtain a submission token from the web page for the assignment.
