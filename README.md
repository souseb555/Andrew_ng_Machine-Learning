## Introduction
**************************************************************************
This repo contains all programming assignments of machine learning course .All the code base, quiz questions, screenshot, and images, are taken from, unless specified, [Machine Learning on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/)

## About the course
****************************************************************************
In this course, you will learn the basics of  Machine Learning, understand how to build neural networks, and learn how to lead successful machine learning projects.The concepts are practisced in MATLAB/OCTAVE.This is a 11 week Course and at the end of every week there will be a set of quizzes and Programming assignmemts(MATLAB/OCTAVE)

## OCTAVE
**********************************************************************************
I have used OCTAVE-5.2.0_1-w64 version to implement programming assignments.You can download the same from [here](https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/octave/windows/octave-5.2.0_1-w64-installer.exe).Dont worry if you are a complete beginner to OCTAVE /MATLAB, a complete tutorial on OCTAVE is found in Course itself.

#### Also Note!

  > You can make use of the Discussion forums in the course so as to resolve any errors you face while doing assignments.[CLICK HERE!](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/supplement/SFKpu/programming-tips-from-mentors)
